# Specification

A specification is a precise description of what a program is supposed to do.[1]

Correctness is only meaningful in respect to a specification.[1]

*   `x = y + 1` is correct in respect to a spec of "Make sure that `x` and `y` had different value` but incorrect in respect to a spec "Make sure that `x` has a negative value."
